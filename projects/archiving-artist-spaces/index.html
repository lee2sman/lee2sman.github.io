				<h1>Archiving Artist-Run Spaces</h1>
				<p>2021 - 2023</p>
				<p>
						An archive project to preserve the online activities of DIY and artist-run communities in the era of born-digital media, providing tools, models for preservation and partnerships with longstanding archives invested in digital preservation. The website presents a toolkit for artist-run organizations providing information, training, tools and other resources.			</p>
				<p>
Archiving Artist-Run Spaces was created as a resource for experimental artist communities, both physical spaces as well as online-only creator communities, to build archives of their activities.
				</p>
				<p>
It is based on my two decades of experience working in DIY spaces and artist-run communities and identifying unmet needs in the space. Just as these spaces attempt to carve out their own place in the world and make their own home and culture, there is a mismatch with their values when artist-run communities use commercial platforms for presenting or hosting their work. Just as an art space could be forced to close due to rising rents, many platforms have come and gone over the years, changed their business models, or sites or passwords have been misplaced. Recognizing that many exhibits, images, articles, web-based projects, and documentation disappears due to link rot this siteâ€™s goal is to help artist-run communities think through the value of what theyâ€™re engaged in and how they may want to strategically preserve some aspect of themselves online. This project isnâ€™t meant to replace the needs for professional archivists but rather to provide possibilities in the DIY spirit of these communities who often rely on the strength of their own networks.
