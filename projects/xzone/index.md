# Xzone

A Do It Together platform for online community-making 

Participants in this workshop will create their own D.I.T. (“Do It Together”) 2D networked online meeting places. We will introduce the idea of virtual temporary autonomous zones based on the concept of temporary autonomous zones, the socio-political tactic of creating temporary spaces to evade formal structures of control. We will teach how to create a simplified networked graphical community meeting space based on this concept, including creating avatars, room interiors and interactive objects, inspired by physical spaces such as the squat, loft, community space, or campsite.

### Chat Topics

- *"how spaces/architecture affects people and communities. both in local physical spaces, and cyberspaces.. there's a concept/practice called "Psychogeographies" from Guy Debord that mixes the experience of exploration with the conscious understanding of how we meander though cities and spaces and what effect that has on our lives."*

- *"for TAZ: I really like the format of festival/conference style events that still retain a community of communities along with the autonomy. There's some music festivals like Fusion and smaller volunteer festivals. Chaos Communication Congress is centered around the TAZ with a community/educational focus and is in a community of community little diy village format."* note: [CCC is online this year](https://events.ccc.de/)
