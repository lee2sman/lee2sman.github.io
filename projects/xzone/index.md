# Xzone

A Do It Together platform for online community-making 

Participants in this workshop will create their own D.I.T. (“Do It Together”) 2D networked online meeting places. We will introduce the idea of virtual temporary autonomous zones based on the concept of temporary autonomous zones, the socio-political tactic of creating temporary spaces to evade formal structures of control. We will teach how to create a simplified networked graphical community meeting space based on this concept, including creating avatars, room interiors and interactive objects, inspired by physical spaces such as the squat, loft, community space, or campsite.
