				<h1>Messlife</h1>
				<p>2017 - 2024</p>
				<p>
					Messlife is a DIY online warehouse for art, music and collaboration: a
					Temporary Autonomous Zone of the sky.
				</p>
				<p>
					Messlife manifests through online and in-person art exhibitions,
					popping up within galleries, alternative spaces and classrooms even as
					its true form is situated within cyberspace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Messlife is both a virtual space as well as an experimental art tool.
					It consists of an open sandbox platform, taking the metaphor of a DIY
					artist warehouse. The environment supports a simultaneous community of
					no more than a few dozen participants who primarily build collaged
					sculptures and digital readymades, skate, or explore its nooks and
					crannies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Useful materials for construction are imported and added or found
					onsite. Any 2d image can be uploaded into the space, immediately
					becoming a 3d asset or artwork used for building in an additive
					constructive manner, used as material for sculpture or to alter one's
					own body or the shifting floor. The horizontal nature of the tool
					means that fine art, memes, personal images, drawings, textures, stock
					photos and screenshots all become readymade materials, and all may be
					discarded or collected from the virtual dumpsters. These re-used
					digital materials are shared by the community. Any participant can use
					anyone else's images, or move, resize, or shift anything. Messlife
					maps out a method for pirates, neighbors, thieves, classmates,
					strangers, friends, provocateurs and comrades to work together in
					cahoots. Messlife supports jamming, the quest for utopia and the
					sublime, and experimentation that may result in failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the warehouse artspace is a skatepark, dumpsters for
					storing and discarding old materials, a performance area, art shack,
					shipping containers, shopping carts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like IRL artist communities, the shared dumpsters take on an outsize
					role here. The virtual dumpster is a generative space for both
					discarding past images or objects and finding new ones, and new works
					can be constructed using this detritus.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the traditional First Person 3d game view, Messlife
					includes a top down world view, both intended as a generative visual
					artwork of its own as well as a result of the collected images and
					manipulations of the participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Messlife opens for temporary events. In this body of documentation,
					images and video captured from the space can themselves be considered
					a constructed artistic output.
				</p>
