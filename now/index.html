Aarhus and CANTINA collective. Part of the Flux Factory residency at <a
href="https://www.aros.dk/en/learning/about-aros-public/">ARoS
Public</a> in Denmark. Produced a <a
href="http://open-source-tools-for-artists.glitch.me/">digital zine</a>
resulting from the workshop.</p>
<p>Created some small software for the <a
href="https://ctrl-c.club/">Ctrl-C Club</a> tilde group.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/bookmobile">bookmobile</a> to
download articles from the web, run them through readability (removes
ads, sidebars, etc), then save as cleaned minimal html, markdown and
epub files. The goal is to make it easy to create a personal archive of
articles and other things from the web, and outside the confines of the
commercial services of products like Pocket. I have a 10 year old ebook
reader (Nook Simple Touch) and this quickly converts articles and books
for easy reading on my e-reader.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/gemstats">gemstats</a> for <a
href="https://ctrl-c.club/">Ctrl-C Club</a> tilde and it‚Äôs already in
use! It gives very basic statistics for readers of one‚Äôs personal gemlog
as well as our tilde community as a whole. As of today we‚Äôve had over
150k readers.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/vwscratchpad">vwscratchpad</a>,
a minimal scratchpad tool to launch from within Vim / Neovim editor when
you need a quick scratchpad. Also runs in browser so I use it as a
phone/tablet sketching tool.</p>
<p>Built <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/minilog">minilog</a>, a tiny
CLI journaling program intended for shorter notes on what I‚Äôm doing, to
look back in future years. It‚Äôs a very simple fish shell script.</p>
<p><a href="https://taper.badquar.to/6/throw_of_the_text.html">A Throw
of the Text</a> is in the current edition of Taper, the online literary
magazine for small computational pieces, published by Bad Quarto. ‚ÄúEach
of the poems in Taper #6 is licensed as free software for you to use,
study, modify, and share however you like.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brion Gysin let the mice in; Taper #6 lets the dice out. This issue
offers 26 computational poems engaging with chance and the number six,
many of which pay tribute to Un coup de d√©s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am also continuing work on new Artists and Hackers episodes and the
Space project collabo, both detailed below.</p>

is an album of generated music created on modular synth and code (monome
teletype), inspired by a 1970s Triadex Muse machine and the first chat

the mid 90s. <em><a

<p><a href="https://notapipe.itch.io/gobi">Gobi</a> is a minimal desert
adventure game in the lineage of early strategy games like The Oregon

my Mac System 7 in the mid-90s, a game that came on a CD-Rom with 100
other games. *<a

<p>I created an implementation of the turtle-drawing LOGO programming
language called <a

p5.js. It includes a retro mode and onscreen console log of the input
file.</p>
<p>Art Homepage Fair - IPDW, working with Arebyte AOS has organized an
online art homepage fair. I built <a

interactive experimental artwork and log that I am updating throughout
the month.</p>
<h3 id="winter-2021">Winter 2021</h3>
<p>Obscure Instructions MOTD - In the spring I created a web-based
Obscure Instructions program, an homage to Oblique Strategies by Brian
Eno / Peter Schmidt. <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/obscure-instructions-motd">Obscure
Instructions MOTD</a> is a command line ‚ÄúMessage of the Day‚Äù node

<p>LeeSD Dream Emulator - Started coding generative sketches of my
dreams. An homage to LSD Dream Emulator, which I‚Äôm waiting to actually

generative dream sketches: <a
href="https://leetusman.com/everyday/161/">1</a> <a

<p>I created a generative self-playing project called Self-Doubting
Systems for MIT <a href="https://arts.mit.edu/cast/">Center for Art,
Science and Technology</a>. It will be featured in an online exhibition
and printed book.</p>

hope to get up a site with more on the system, instructions, code. I
wrote a <a
