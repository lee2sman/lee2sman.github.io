					<p><strong>Reimagining the Third Space: New Metaphors for Online Creative Communities</strong> will be presented as part of the New Media Caucus Media Lounge events. This discussion is organized in collaboration with <a href='https://aliceyuanzhang.com/' alt='Alice Yuan Zhang website'>Alice Yuan Zhang</a>, with <a href='https://laja.me/' alt='Artist LaJune McMillian'>LaJunÃ© McMillian</a>, <a href='http://www.laurengardner.com/' alt='Lauren'>Lauren Gardner</a>, <a href='https://kristinmcwharter.com/' alt='artist Kristin McWharter'>Kristin McWharter</a>.

					<h3>December 3, 2020</h3>
					<p>
					I am speaking at the 31st Annual Workshop, a conference of The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) in the panel <em>Digressions on Expression</em>. The <a href="https://www.ppig.org/workshops/2020-annual-workshop/" alt="PPIG website">full conference</a> runs November 30 - December 4.

					</p>

					<h3>November 2020</h3>
					<p>
					I am presenting Messlife in the online exhibition <a href='http://accumulations.online/exhibition.html' alt='Accumulations Online exhibition'>Accumulations.online</a>, a project of -empyre- soft-skinned space, curated by Daniel Lichtman. The online exhibit prominently features a generative swirling miasmi of images churning through Messlife. A video shows a moment in time of the environment, with accompanying soundtrack.
					</p>

					<h3>October 2020</h3>
					<p>
					I have two new articles up on <a href='https//opensource.com' alt='Open Source'>OpenSource.com</a>, <em>a publication focused on open source and Linux tutorials, stories, and resources</em>. The article <a href='https://opensource.com/article/20/9/run-linux-ios' alt='Run Linux on iOS on Opensource.com'>Run the Linux command line on your iPad</a> explains how to properly access a Linux command line to run your own software on the famously locked-down proprietary iOS ecosystem. My most recent article <a href='https://opensource.com/article/20/10/gemini-ios'>Browse the web using Gemini on your Apple device</a> explains how to use AV-98 to browse <a href='https://gemini.circumlunar.space/' alt='Project Gemini'>Project Gemini</a>. Gemini is a brand new internet protocol alternative to the World Wide Web. There is already a burgeoning and exciting community of folks creating personal websites and sharing news and blogs. It works in contrast to the closed, slow and big-box ecosystem of the major browsers and platforms online. AV-98 is one of many text-based browsers for the command line that will work on any device or computer with a command line and Python.</p>

					<h3>September 5, 2020</h3>

					<p>
						I am giving a talk on <em>DIY and Virtual Artist-Run Spaces</em> for
						the
						<a href="http://gameartengines.com" alt="Game Art Engines"
							>Game Engines Beyond Games symposium</a
						>
						originally organized in conjunction with Abertay University in Scotland to be held at Parsons School of Design. The event will now be held online. <em>Update: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUzylcqLOPA" alt="video link to DIY and Virtual Artist-Run Spaces">video</a>.</em>
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						Game engines have been increasingly utilized in a variety of
						applications, from AI training, VR architectural simulations, to
						creating artworks. However, most of these uses only consider the
						game engine as a tool, rather than a medium. Despite the
						availability of different game engines, we must also consider what
						sort of thinking a particular engine puts forth. The military
						provenance of the term â€˜engineâ€™ may point towards contentious
						issues. Engines presuppose infrastructure: the road for the internal
						combustion engine, the railway for the steam engine. These engines
						have often entailed colonialism and imperialism, enclosed commons
						and uncontained emissions. Are there similar considerations at work
						with game engines, for example in the exploitation of vernacular
						creativity or the environmental costs of streaming technology? How
						can artistic work illuminate these concerns? What does it mean for
						artistic practitioners and theorists to work with, build, and modify
						game engines today? What can creative works tell us about the nature
						of contemporary game engines?
