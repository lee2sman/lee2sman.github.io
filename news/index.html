					I'm in residence at <a href="https://www.plexusprojects.org/programming/artist-in-residence-lee-tusman" alt="Plexus Projects">Plexus Projects</a> in Brooklyn, working on the podcast end of season 1 as well as generative minimal 8bit artware (in Puzzlescript). I'm excited to show the works I've made and do a write-up about the projects, programming engine, pixel art constraints and my hacks. I'm creating small game-like works that live in the web-browser, using a minimal 8bit videogame aesthetic to create ambient narratives accompanied by generative chip-style music in the interface of a videogame engine.</p>
					</p>

					<p>I will be in residency with Flux Factory on Governor's Island August 20 - October 30</p>


					<h3>June 2021</h3>
					<p>
					I am currently at work on an experimental archival project with <a href="https://space1026.com/" alt="Space 1026">Space 1026</a> a 23-year old artist collective in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In this process I have been conducting oral histories, building a digital photo archive, creating zine-making software for the collective and creating a website capsule. A project site will be launched summer 2021. The project has been incubated through NEW INC, with funding support by the Knight Foundation.
					</p>

					<p>
					Thanks to financial support by the City of New York Department of Cultural Affairs I am completing the first year of multi-year support for the Babycastles Academy I designed and lead. These are workshops I organize on behalf of Babycastles in New York City, on topics related to artist-focused game development, world-building and the intersection of art and technology. We have held 25 public workshops online in the past year, and 30 since the beginning of the pandemic. All <a href="https://babycastles.github.io/Babycastles-Academy/" alt="Babycastles Academy">lesson plans</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJzpMnmDTJIUBNOpzI5qdPJ1cXhITBSq-" alt="Babycastles Academy on YouTube">video recordings</a> are available online. 
					</p>
					<p>
					I am presenting the work <em>A Throw Of the Text</em> in the current issue of <a href='https://taper.badquar.to/6/' alt='Taper Magazine'>Taper Magazine #6</a>: A Throw of the Dice. Taper is an online literary journal for computational poetry and literary art published twice yearly by Bad Quarto. The issue is edited by a collective. Editing and production is done in coordination with The Trope Tank at MIT. The source code for the works are published under an open source license and intended to be viewed as well. The issue offers computational poems engaging with chance and the number six, many of which pay tribute to Mallarme's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_coup_de_d%C3%A9s_jamais_n%27abolira_le_hasard_(Mallarm%C3%A9)" alt="Un coup de dÃ©s jamais n'abolira le hasard (MallarmÃ©)">A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</a>.

					<h3>October 2020</h3>
					<p>
						I have two new articles up on
						<a href="https//opensource.com" alt="Open Source">OpenSource.com</a
						>,

							>a publication focused on open source and Linux tutorials,
							stories, and resources</em
						>. The article
						<a
							href="https://opensource.com/article/20/9/run-linux-ios"
							alt="Run Linux on iOS on Opensource.com"
							>Run the Linux command line on your iPad</a
						>
						explains how to properly access a Linux command line to run your own
						software on the famously locked-down proprietary iOS ecosystem. My
						most recent article
						<a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/10/gemini-ios"
							>Browse the web using Gemini on your Apple device</a
						>
						explains how to use AV-98 to browse
						<a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/" alt="Project Gemini"
							>Project Gemini</a
						>. Gemini is a brand new internet protocol alternative to the World
						Wide Web. There is already a burgeoning and exciting community of
						folks creating personal websites and sharing news and blogs. It
						works in contrast to the closed, slow and big-box ecosystem of the
						major browsers and platforms online. AV-98 is one of many text-based
						browsers for the command line that will work on any device or
						computer with a command line and Python.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Game engines have been increasingly utilized in a variety of
						applications, from AI training, VR architectural simulations, to
						creating artworks. However, most of these uses only consider the
						game engine as a tool, rather than a medium. Despite the
						availability of different game engines, we must also consider what
						sort of thinking a particular engine puts forth. The military
						provenance of the term â€˜engineâ€™ may point towards contentious
						issues. Engines presuppose infrastructure: the road for the internal
						combustion engine, the railway for the steam engine. These engines
						have often entailed colonialism and imperialism, enclosed commons
						and uncontained emissions. Are there similar considerations at work
						with game engines, for example in the exploitation of vernacular
						creativity or the environmental costs of streaming technology? How
						can artistic work illuminate these concerns? What does it mean for
						artistic practitioners and theorists to work with, build, and modify
						game engines today? What can creative works tell us about the nature
						of contemporary game engines?
